            Extensions to existing call structure


    Name:   *   Alloc - allocate memory

    Assembler usage:
            MOV     BX,size
            MOV     AH,Alloc
            INT     21h
        ; AX:0 is pointer to allocated memory
        ; if alloc fails, BX is the largest block available

    Description:
            Alloc returns a pointer to a free block of  memory
        that has the requested size in paragraphs.

    Error return:
        AX = error_not_enough_memory
                The  largest  available  free block is smaller
                than that requested or there is no free block.
           = error_arena_trashed
                The internal consistency of the  memory  arena
                has  been  destroyed.   This  is due to a user
                program changing memory that does  not  belong
                to it.


    Name:   *   CharOper - change  incompatible  configuration
                parameters

    Assembler usage:
            MOV     AH, CharOper
            MOV     AL, func
            MOV     DL, data
            INT     21h
        ; on read functions, data is returned in DL

    Description:
            CharOper   allows   a  program  to  change  system
        parameters to allow for switch indicators and  whether
        devices are  available at every level of the directory
        tree.

            A function code is passed in AL:

        AL  Function
        --  --------
         0  DL,  on  return,  will  contain  the  DOS   switch
            character.   On  most systems this will default to
            '-'.
         1  Set the switch character to the character in DL.
         2  Read the device availability  byte  into  DL.   If
            this  byte  is 0, then devices must be accessed in
            file I/O calls by /dev/device.  If  this  byte  is
            non-zero, then  the devices are available at every
            node of  the  directory  tree  (i.e.  CON  is  the
            console  device  not  the file CON).  This byte is
            generally 0.
         3  Set  the  device availability byte to the value in
            DL.

    Error returns:
        AL = FF
                The function code specified in AL  is  not  in
                the range 0:3


    Name:   *   CurrentDir - return text of current  directory

    Assembler usage:
                MOV     AH,CurrentDir
                LDS     SI,area
                MOV     DL,drive
                INT     21h
            ; DS:SI is a pointer to 64 byte area that contains
            ; drive current directory.

    Description:
            CurrentDir returns the  current  directory  for  a
        particular drive.   The directory is root-relative and
        does not contain the drive specifier.  The drive  code
        passed in DL is 0=default, 1=A, 2=B, etc.

    Error returns:
        AX = error_invalid_drive
                The drive specified in DL was invalid.


    Name:   *   Dealloc - free allocated memory

    Assembler usage:
            MOV     ES,block
            MOV     AH,dealloc
            INT     21h

    Description:
            Dealloc  returns  a  piece of memory to the system
        pool that was allocated by alloc.

    Error return:
        AX = error_invalid_block
                The block passed in ES is  not  one  allocated
                via Alloc.
           = error_arena_trashed
                The internal consistency of the  memory  arena
                has  been  destroyed.   This  is due to a user
                program changing memory that does  not  belong
                to it.


    Name:   *   FileTimes  -  get/set  the  write  times  of a
                handle

    Assembler usage:
            MOV AH, FileTimes
            MOV AL, func
            MOV BX, handle
        ; if AL = 1 then then next two are mandatory
            MOV CX, time
            MOV DX, date
            INT 21h
        ; if AL = 0 then CX/DX has the last write time/date
        ; for the handle.

    Description:
            FileTimes returns or sets the last-write time  for
        a handle.  These times are not recorded until the file
        is closed.

            A function code is passed in AL:

        AL  Function
        --  --------
         0  Return the time/date of the handle in CX/DX
         1  Set the time/date of the handle to CX/DX

    Error returns:
        AX = error_invalid_function
                The function passed in AL was not in the range
                0:1.
           = error_invalid_handle
                The handle passed  in  BX  was  not  currently
                open.


    Name:   *   FindFirst - find matching file

    Assembler usage:
            MOV AH, FindFirst
            LDS DX, pathname
            MOV CX, attr
            INT 21h
        ; DMA address has datablock

    Description:
            FindFirst takes a pathname with wildcards  in  the
        last component  (passed in DS:DX), a set of attributes
        (passed in CX) and attempts to  find  all  files  that
        match  the  pathname and have a subset of the required
        attributes.  A datablock at the current DMA is written
        that contains information in the following form:

            find_buf    STRUC

            find_buf    ENDS

            To obtain  the subsequent matches of the pathname,
        see the description of FindNext

    Error Returns:
        AX = error_file_not_found
                The path specified in  DS:DX  was  an  invalid
                path.
           = error_no_more_files
                There    were    no    files   matching   this
                specification.


    Name:   *   FindNext  -  step through a directory matching

            IRET
        DoFunc: ...

    Description:
            Return location of indos flag.  On return ES:BX is
        the address of a byte memory cell inside the DOS.   If
        used  in  an  interrupt  service routine, it indicates
        whether or not the DOS was interrupted in  a  critical
        section.   If  the cell was zero, then the DOS was not
        in a critical section and thus can be  called  by  the
        interrupt routine.   If the cell was non-zero, the DOS
        should be considered to be in an uninterruptable state
        and for reliability, no DOS calls should be given.

    Error returns:
            None.


    Name:   *   GetVector -  get interrupt vector

    Description:
            MSDOS  ordinarily  checks  for   a   ^C   on   the
        controlling  device  only  when  doing a function 1-12
        operation to that device.  SetCtrlCTrapping allows the
        user  to  expand  this  checking to include any system
        call.  For example, with the ^C trapping off, all disk
        I/O  will  proceed  without interruption while with ^C
        trapping on, the ^C interrupt is given at  the  system
        call that initiates the disk operation.

    Description:

            calls to DS:DX. To return the 0F9H-0FFH calls to
            the uninitialized state, give DS=DX=-1.

    Error returns:
            None.

    Handler entry:
            All registers as user  set  them  when  INT  21H
            issued  (including  SS:SP).  INT 21 return is on
            stack, so the correct method for the OEM handler
            to  return  to the user is to give an IRET.  The
            OEM handler is free to make any INT  21H  system
            call  (including the 0F9H- 0FFH group if the OEM
            handler is re-entrant).


    The  AH  INT  21H  function  codes 0F8H through 0FFH are
    reserved for OEM  extensions  to  the  INT  21H  calling
    convention.   These  calls  have two states, initialized
    and uninitialized.  There will be one handler for all  7
    (0F9-0FFH)   functions.    When   the   DOS   is   first
    initialized, these calls are uninitialized.  The AH=0F8H
    call  is the call which will set the handler address for
    the  0F9-0FFH  calls.   If  the   0F9-0FFH   calls   are
    uninitialized,  an  attempt  to call them results in the
    normal invalid system call number return.
    OEMs should NOT document the 0F8 call.

        Previous  to  version  2.0,  MSDOS had a simple single
    directory structure that sufficed for small (160k to 320K)
    diskettes.   As  the need for hard disk support grows, and
    as MSDOS 2.0 will support a wide variety  of  hard  disks,
    the need  for better disk organization also grows.  Merely
    expanding the directory  is  not  an  effective  solution;
    doing  a  'DIR'  on  a  directory with 1000 files is not a
    user-friendly characteristic.

        People,  by  nature,  think  in  hierarchical   terms:
    organization  charts  and  family  trees, for example.  It
    would be nice to allow users to organize  their  files  on
    disk in a similar manner.  Consider the following:

        In  a  particular  business, both sales and accounting
    share a computer with a  large  disk  and  the  individual
    employees   use   it   for   preparation  of  reports  and
    maintaining accounting information.  One  would  naturally
    view  the  organization  of  files  on  the  disk  in this
    fashion:

                          +-disk-+
                         /        \
                        /          \
                       /            \
                    sales         accounting
                   /    |            |      \
                  /     |            |       \
                 /      |            |        \
            John       Mary         Steve      Sue
           /  | (A)       |         |   |         \
          /   |           |         |   |          \
         /    |           |         |   |           \
      report accts.     report   accts. report      report
             receiv.             receiv

        In MSDOS  2.0 the user can arrange his files in such a
    manner that files that are not part of his current task do
    not  interfere  with that task.  Pre-2.0 versions of MSDOS
    has a single directory that contains files.  MSDOS extends
    this  concept  to  allow a directory to contain both files
    and  directories  and  to  introduce  the  notion  of  the
    'current' directory.

        To  specify  a filename, the user could use one of two
    methods, either specify a path from the root node  to  the
    file, or specify a path from the current node to the file.
    A path is a series of directory names separated by '/' and
    ending  with  a  filename.  A path that starts at the root
    begins with a '/'.

        There is a special directory entry in each  directory,
    denoted by '..'  that is the parent of the directory.  The
    root directory's parent is itself (who created God?).

        Using a directory structure like the hierarchy  above,
    and  assuming  that the current directory is at point (D),
    to reference the report under John, the following are  all
    equivalent:

        report
        /sales/John/report
        ../John/report

        To  refer  to the report under Mary, the following are
    all equivalent:

        ../Mary/report
        /sales/Mary/report

        To  refer  to  the report under Sue, the following are
    all equivalent.

        ../../accounting/Sue/report
        /accounting/Sue/report

        There is no restriction in MSDOS 2.0 on the depth of a
    tree (the length of the longest path from  root  to  leaf)
    except  in  the number of allocation units available.  The
    root directory will have a fixed number of entries, 64 for
    the  single  sided diskettes to XXX for a large hard disk.
    For non-root directories, there is no limit to the  number
    of   files  per  directory  excepting  in  the  number  of
    allocation units available.

        Old (pre-2.0) disks will appear to MSDOS 2.0 as having
    only   a   root   directory   with  files  in  it  and  no
    subdirectories whatever.

        Implementation of the tree-structure is  simple.   The
    root  directory  is the pre-2.0 directory.  Subdirectories
    of the root have a special attribute set  indicating  that
    they  are  directories.  The subdirectories themselves are
    files, linked through the FAT as  usual.   Their  contents
    are  identical  in  character  to the contents of the root
    directory.

        Pre-2.0 programs that use system calls  not  described
    below  will  not  be  able  to  make use of files in other
    directories.  They will only be able to  access  files  in
    the   current   directory.   This  is  no  great  loss  of
    functionality as users will  aggregate  their  files  into
    sub-directories on  basis of functionality; the files that
    are being used will be found  in  the  current  directory.
    Those that  are not necessary for the current task will be
    placed in other directories.  Out of sight, out of mind.

        There are also new attributes in 2.0.  These  and  the
    old attributes apply to the tree structured directories in
    the following manner:

    Attribute   Meaning/Function        Meaning/Function
                    for files            for directories

    volume_id   Present at the root.    Meaningless.

                                        changed with ChMod.

            NOTE:   When  control  is  returned,  via  a ^C or
                terminate, from the program being  EXECed  ALL
                registers  are  altered  including  the stack.
                This is because control is returned  from  the
                EXECed  program,  not  the  system.  To regain
                your stack, store an SS:SP  value  in  a  data
                location reachable from your CS.

            Note  that  all  open  files  of  a  process   are
        duplicated  in  the child process after an Exec.  This
        is extremely powerful; the parent process has  control
        over the meanings of stdin, stdout, stderr, stdaux and
        stdprn.  The parent could, for example, write a series
        of records to a file, open the file as standard input,
        open a listing file as standard output and then Exec a
        sort  program  that  takes  its  input  from stdin and
        writes to stdout.

            Also inherited (or passed from the parent)  is  an
        'environment'.  This  is a block of text strings (less
        than   32K   bytes   total)   that   convey    various
        configurations   parameters.    The   format   of  the
        environment is as follows:

                     (paragraph boundary)
                +---------------------------+
                | BYTE asciz string 1       |
                +---------------------------+
                | BYTE asciz string 2       |
                +---------------------------+
                | ...                       |
                +---------------------------+
                | BYTE asciz string n       |
                +---------------------------+
                | BYTE of zero              |
                +---------------------------+

            Typically the environment strings have the form:

            parameter=value

        for  example,  COMMAND.COM always passes its execution
        search path as:

            PATH=A:/BIN;B:/BASIC/LIB

        A zero value of the environment address will cause the
        child  process  to  inherit  the  parent's environment
        unchanged.

            Note that on a successful return  from  EXEC,  all
        registers, except for CS:IP, are changed.

    Error return:
        AX = error_invalid_function
                The function passed in AL was not 0, 1 or 3.
           = error_bad_environment
                The environment was larger than 32Kb.
           = error_bad_format
                The file pointed to by DS:DX was an EXE format
                file   and   contained  information  that  was
                internally inconsistent.
           = error_not_enough_memory

    Description:
            Set or Get device information associated with open
        Handle,  or  send/receive  control  string  to  device
        Handle or device.

            The following values are allowed for func:

        Request Function
        ------  --------
           0    Get device information (returned in DX)
           1    Set device information (as determined by DX)
           2    Read CX number of bytes into DS:DX from device
                control channel.
           3    Write CX  number of bytes from DS:DX to device

           6    Get input status
           7    Get output status

            Ioctl can be used to get information about  device
        channels.   It  is  ok  to make Ioctl calls on regular
        files but only calls 0,6 and 7  are  defined  in  that
        case   (AL=0,6,7),   all   other   calls   return   an
        error_invalid_function error.

    CALLS AL=0 and AL=1

            The bits of DX are defined as  follows  for  calls
        AL=0 and  AL=1.  Note that the upper byte MUST be zero
        on a set call.

        Bits 15,8-13,4 are reserved and should not be altered.

    Calls 2..5:
        These four calls allow arbitrary control strings to be
        sent or received from a device.  The  Call  syntax  is
        the same as the READ and WRITE calls, except for 4 and
        5 which take a drive number in BL instead of a  handle
        in BX.

        An  error_invalid_function  error  is  returned if the
        CTRL bit (see above) is 0.

        An error_access_denied is returned by calls AL=4,5  if
        the drive number is invalid.

    Calls 6,7:
        These two calls allow the user  to  check  if  a  file
        handle  is  ready  for  input  or  output.   Status of
        handles open to a device is the intended use of  these
        calls,  but  status of a handle open to a disk file is
        OK and is defined as follows:

            Input:
                Always  ready  (AL=FF) until EOF reached, then
                always  not  ready   (AL=0)   unless   current
                position changed via LSEEK.
            Output:
                Always ready (even if disk full).

        IMPORTANT NOTE:
           The status is defined at the  time  the  system  is
           CALLED.  On future versions, by the time control is
           returned to the user from the  system,  the  status
           returned may NOT correctly reflect the true current
           state of the device or file.

        bytes will be read;  for  example,  reading  from  the
        keyboard  will  read at most one line of text.  If the
        returned value is zero, then the program has tried  to
        read from the end of file.

            All  I/O  is  done  using  normalized pointers; no
        segment wraparound will occur.

    Error returns:
        AX = error_invalid_handle
                The handle passed  in  BX  was  not  currently
                open.
           = error_access_denied
                The handle passed in BX was opened in  a  mode
                that did not allow reading.


    Name:   *   RmDir - Remove a directory entry

    Assembler usage:
            LDS     DX, name
            MOV     AH, RmDir
            INT     21h

    Description:
            RmDir is given an asciz name of a directory.  That
        directory is removed from its parent

    Error returns:
        AX = error_path_not_found
                The path specified was invalid or not found.
           = error_access_denied
                The  path  specified  was  not  empty,  not  a
                directory, the  root  directory  or  contained
                invalid information.
           = error_current_directory
                The  path  specified was the current directory
                on a drive.


    Name:   *   Unlink - delete a directory entry

    Assembler usage:
            LDS     DX, name
            MOV     AH, Unlink
            INT     21h

    Description:
            Unlink removes a directory entry associated with a
        filename.   If  the  file is currently open on another
        handle, then no removal will take place.

    Error returns:
        AX = error_file_not_found
                The path specified was invalid or not found.
           = error_access_denied
                The   path   specified   was  a  directory  or
                read-only.


    Name:   *   Wait - retrieve the return code of a child

    Assembler usage:
            MOV     AH, Wait
            INT 21h
        ; AX has the exit code

    Description:
            Wait  will  return  the  Exit  code specified by a
        child process.  It will return  this  Exit  code  only
        once.   The  low byte of this code is that sent by the
        Exit routine.  The high byte is one of the  following:

            0 - terminate/abort
            1 - ^C
            2 - Hard error
            3 - Terminate and stay resident

    Error returns:
            None.


    Name:   *   Write - write to a file

    Assembler usage:
            LDS     DX, buf
            MOV     CX, count
            MOV     BX, handle
            MOV     AH, Write
            INT     21h
        ; AX has number of bytes written

    Description:
            Write transfers  count  bytes  from  a buffer into
        a file.  It should be regarded  as  an  error  if  the
        number of  bytes written is not the same as the number
        requested.

            It is  important  to  note  that  the write system
        call with a count of  zero  (CX  =  0)  will  truncate
        the file at the current position.

            All I/O  is  done  using  normalized  pointers; no
        segment wraparound will occur.

    Error Returns:
        AX = error_invalid_handle
                The handle passed  in  BX  was  not  currently
                open.
           = error_access_denied
                The handle  was  not  opened  in  a  mode that
                allowed writing.


The following  XENIX  convention  is  followed for the new 2.0
system calls:

    o   If no error occurred, then  the  carry  flag  will  be
        reset and  register  AX  will  contain the appropriate
        information.

    o   If an error occurred, then  the  carry  flag  will  be
        set and  register  AX  will  contain  the  error code.

The following  code  sample illustrates the recommended method
of detecting these errors:

        ...
        MOV     errno,0
        INT     21h
        JNC     continue
        MOV     errno,AX
continue:
        ...

The word variable errno will now have the correct  error  code
for that system call.

The current equates for the error codes are:

no_error_occurred               EQU 0

error_invalid_function          EQU 1
error_file_not_found            EQU 2
